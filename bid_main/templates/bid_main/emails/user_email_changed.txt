Hi {{ user.full_name|default:user.email }}!


Somebody, probably you, changed your email address on Blender
ID, from {{ old_email }} to {{ user.email }}.

This notification is sent to both your old and your new email
addresses. If you did not receive it at your new address, please
verify that your address is correct.

If this change was not your intent, or you made a mistake, please
log in with {{ user.email }} and your current password at
{{ blender_id }} and you'll be able to change it back. You can
always contact us at cloudsupport@blender.org about this as well.

Use your new email address ({{ user.email }}) to log in to any
Blender ID enabled website, such as Blender Cloud, Blender
Network, Blender Store, etc.

Check your dashboard at {{ blender_id }} for more information.


Kind regards,

The Blender Web Team
